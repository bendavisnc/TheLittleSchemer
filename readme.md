# The Little Scala Schemer

#### Just some code of mine as I've been working through the great classic -  [The Little Schemer][amazonLink]

### A few things I'm hoping to gain from this book (even though it's over twenty years old)
  - ### An improved ability to think recursivly
  - ### An introductory view of Lisp based programming (Although I am working through it in Scala)
  - ### A better understanding of problem solving via functional based approaches

&nbsp;


### Why I love this book (And perhaps you will too!)
  - ### It takes a slow  sequential approach into teaching the differences between functions that are primitive, and functions that can  be composed from those primitives and other composite functions.
  - ### Its style is completely unique from any other textbook I've ever come across. You don't "read" page by page. Instead it's more like a question and answer conversation - where you read the left side of a page, think about it, and then compare your initial thought to the answer waiting on the right side of the page.

### This is an SBT project. To run, simply clone this project and run in a console, "sbt test"
